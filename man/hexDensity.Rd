\usage{
hexDensity(x, ...)

\method{hexDensity}{SpatialExperiment}(
  x,
  assay = assayNames(x)[1],
  xbins = 128,
  sigma = 1,
  edge = TRUE,
  diggle = FALSE,
  weight = NULL,
  weightTransform = NULL

\method{hexDensity}{default}(
  x,
  y = NULL,
  xbins = 128,
  sigma = 1,
  edge = TRUE,
  diggle = FALSE,
  weight = NULL,
  test = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{Coords of the points or a single plotting structure to be used in binning. See xy.coords.}

\item{assay}{assay to be used of the SpatialExperiment object}

\item{xbins}{Number of bins in a row.}

\item{sigma}{Bandwidth for kernel density calculation.}

\item{edge}{Logical value for whether to apply edge correction. Default is TRUE.}

\item{diggle}{Logical value for apply edge correction with the more accurate Jones-Diggle methor (need 'edge' to be TRUE).}

\item{weight}{numeric weight vector to be assigned to points. For SpatialExperiment, this can be a name in rownames or colData (transformation may be needed to turn data into numerical values)}

\item{weightTransform}{a function that can take in the weight vector to return a vector of same length. For SpatialExperiment, one may want to use this to transform string into numerical values (e.g.: transform cell_class in colData into binary boolean for selection of a specific class)}
